Our Client case2Analytics specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies to develop and retain employees. They have provided a dataset and asked us to identify factors that lead to attrition and to build a model to predict attrition. They are also interested in identifying some interesting trends between Job Roles as well as building a model to predict Salaries.

To start the exploration we will load the data and perform univariate analysis

```{r univariate}
case2 = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RashmiAPatel19/SMU_MSDS_6306_CaseStudy2_Spring2021/main/CaseStudy2-data.csv", header = TRUE)
head(case2)
dim(case2)
#Create List of numeric variables
case2_numeric <- names(case2 %>% select(where(is.numeric)))
#remove ID, EmployeeNumber and categorical/character variables
case2_numeric <- case2_numeric[-c(1,7)]
case2_numeric

#Create List of non-numeric varibles
case2_categorical <- names(case2 %>% select(!where(is.numeric)))

#Convert character variables to factors
case2[sapply(case2, is.character)] <- lapply(case2[sapply(case2, is.character)], as.factor)

plot_histogram(case2)
#EmployeeNumber and ID are identifers, not for further analysis
#Non-normal or skewed distributions for DistanceFromHome, MonthlyIncome, NumCompaniesWorked, PercentSalaryHike, TotalWorkingYears, YearsInCurrentRole, YearsSinceLastPromotion
 
#Perform Log transformations for variables with non-normal distributions
case2_transformed <- case2
case2_transformed["logDistanceFromHome"] = log(case2_transformed$DistanceFromHome)
case2_transformed["logMonthlyIncome"] = log(case2_transformed$MonthlyIncome)
case2_transformed["logNumCompaniesWorked"] = log(case2_transformed$NumCompaniesWorked)
case2_transformed["logPercentSalaryHike"] = log(case2_transformed$PercentSalaryHike)
case2_transformed["logTotalWorkingYears"] = log(case2_transformed$TotalWorkingYears)
case2_transformed["logYearsInCurrentRole"] = log(case2_transformed$YearsInCurrentRole)
case2_transformed["logYearsSinceLastPromotion"] = log(case2_transformed$YearsSinceLastPromotion)

case2_transformed = subset(case2_transformed, select = -c(DistanceFromHome,MonthlyIncome,NumCompaniesWorked,PercentSalaryHike,TotalWorkingYears,YearsInCurrentRole,YearsSinceLastPromotion))

#Replace -inf from log transformation with 0
case2_transformed <- case2_transformed %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, function(x) ifelse(is.infinite(x), 0, x))

#Log transformations show more normal distributions
plot_histogram(case2_transformed)

plot_bar(case2)
#Over18 is all "Y", StandardHours all 80, EmployeeCount all 1, may not be valuable for further analysis
```

Explore Correlations and relationships between variables

```{r corr-EDA}
#Create function to summarize the most significant correlations since there are too many variables for one plot
corr_simple <- function(data=df,sig=0.5){
  #convert data to numeric in order to run correlations
  #convert to factor first to keep the integrity of the data - each value will become a number rather than turn into NA
  df_cor <- data %>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
  df_cor <- df_cor %>% mutate_if(is.factor, as.numeric)
  #run a correlation and drop the insignificant ones
  corr <- cor(df_cor)
  #prepare to drop duplicates and correlations of 1     
  corr[lower.tri(corr,diag=TRUE)] <- NA 
  #drop perfect correlations
  corr[corr == 1] <- NA 
  #turn into a 3-column table
  corr <- as.data.frame(as.table(corr))
  #remove the NA values from above 
  corr <- na.omit(corr) 
  #select significant values  
  corr <- subset(corr, abs(Freq) > sig) 
  #sort by highest correlation
  corr <- corr[order(-abs(corr$Freq)),] 
  #print table
  print(corr)
  #turn corr back into matrix in order to plot with corrplot
  mtx_corr <- reshape2::acast(corr, Var1~Var2, value.var="Freq")
  
  #plot correlations visually
  corrplot(mtx_corr, is.corr=FALSE, tl.col="black", na.label=" ")
}
corr_simple(case2_transformed)

Evaluate significance of categorical variables effect on Attrition:

Based on Chi-Square tests, difference in Attrition rates are highly significant between categories for: OverTime, JobRole, MaritalStatus

There is also some significant difference for: Department, and BusinessTravel

```{r Cat-v-Attrition, message=FALSE}

#Both Sales Reps and Sales Executives included in "Sales" Department, JobRole showed significant difference between Rep & Exec. Based on Lack of Independence, Department could be dropped from Attrition rate predections

Evaluate significance of Numerical Variables on Attrition

Variable Importance and selection for predicting Attrition
